# Strelka
Strelka is a real-time, container-based file scanning system used for threat hunting, threat detection, and incident response. Originally based on the design established by Lockheed Martin's [Laika BOSS](https://github.com/lmco/laikaboss) and similar projects (see: [related projects](#related-projects)), Strelka's purpose is to perform file extraction and metadata collection at enterprise scale.

Strelka differs from its sibling projects in a few significant ways:
* Core codebase is Go and Python3.6+
* Server components run in containers for ease and flexibility of deployment
* OS-native client applications for Windows, Mac, and Linux
* Built using [libraries and formats](#architecture) that allow cross-platform, cross-language support

## Frequently Asked Questions
### "Who is Strelka?"
[Strelka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_space_dogs#Belka_and_Strelka) is one of the second generation Soviet space dogs to achieve orbital spaceflight -- the name is an homage to [Lockheed Martin's Laika BOSS](https://github.com/lmco/laikaboss), one of the first public projects of this type and from which Strelka's core design is based.

### "Why would I want a file scanning system?"
File metadata is an additional pillar of data (alongside network, endpoint, authentication, and cloud) that is effective in enabling threat hunting, threat detection, and incident response and can help event analysts and incident responders bridge visibility gaps in their environment. This type of system is especially useful for identifying threat actors during [KC3 and KC7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_chain#Computer_security_model). For examples of what Strelka can do, please read the [use cases](#use-cases).

### "Should I switch from my current file scanning system to Strelka?"
It depends -- we recommend reviewing the features of each and choosing the most appropriate tool for your needs. We believe the most significant motivating factors for switching to Strelka are:
* More scanners (40+ at release) and file types (60+ at release) than [related projects](#related-projects)
* Modern codebase (Go and Python3.6+)
* Server components run in containers for ease and flexibility of deployment
* Performant, OS-native client applications compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux
* OS-native client applications for Windows, Mac, and Linux
* Built using [libraries and formats](#architecture) that allow cross-platform, cross-language support

### "Are Strelka's scanners compatible with Laika BOSS, File Scanning Framework, or Assemblyline?"
Due to differences in design, Strelka's scanners are not directly compatible with Laika BOSS, File Scanning Framework, or Assemblyline. With some effort, most scanners can likely be ported to the other projects.

### "Is Strelka an intrusion detection system (IDS)?"
Strelka shouldn't be thought of as an IDS, but it can be used for threat detection through YARA rule matching and downstream metadata interpretation. Strelka's design follows the philosophy established by other popular metadata collection systems (Bro, Sysmon, Volatility, etc.): it extracts data and leaves the decision-making up to the user.

### "Does it work at scale?"
Everyone has their own definition of "at scale," but we have been using Strelka and systems like it to scan up to 250 million files each day for over a year and have never reached a point where the system could not scale to our needs -- as file volume and diversity increases, horizontally scaling the system should allow you to scan any number of files.

### "Doesn't this use a lot of bandwidth?"
Maybe! Strelka's client applications provide opportunities for users to use as much or as little bandwidth as they want.

### "Should I run my Strelka cluster on my Bro/Suricata network sensor?"
No! Strelka clusters run CPU-intensive processes that will negatively impact system-critical applications like Bro and Suricata. If you want to integrate a network sensor with Strelka, then use the [`filestream`] client application. This utility is capable of sending millions of files per day from a single network sensor to a Strelka cluster without impacting system-critical applications.

### "I have other questions!"
Please file an issue or contact the project team at [TTS-CFC-OpenSource@target.com](mailto:TTS-CFC-OpenSource@target.com). The project lead can also be reached on Twitter at [@jshlbrd](https://twitter.com/jshlbrd).

## Installation
Strelka can be installed on any system that can run [containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container). For convenience, the project ships with [docker-compse](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) configuration files for standing up a "quickstart" cluster (found under the `build/` directory). We do not recommend using and do not plan to support OS-native installations.

### Client Install
Strelka's core client apps are written in Go and can be run natively on a host or inside of a container.

    go build -o strelka-filestream .
    ```

#### strelka-filestream (container)
1. Clone this repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/target/strelka.git /opt/strelka/
    ```

2. Build the container
    ```sh
    cd /opt/strelka/
    docker build -f build/go/filestream/Dockerfile -t strelka-filestream .
    ```

### Server Install
Strelka's core server components are written in Go and Python3.6 and are run from containers. The simplest way to run them is to use docker-compose -- see `build/docker-compose.yaml` for a sample configuration.

#### Docker
1. Clone this repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/target/strelka.git /opt/strelka/
    ```

2. Build the cluster
    ```sh
    cd /opt/strelka/
    docker-compose -f build/docker-compose.yaml up -d
    ```

## Quickstart
By default, Strelka is configured to use a minimal "quickstart" deployment that allows users to test the system. This configuration **is not recommended** for production deployments, but may suffice for environments with very low file volume (<50k files per day). Using two Terminal windows, do the following:

Terminal 1
```
$ docker-compose -f build/docker-compose.yaml up
```

Terminal 2:
```
$ strelka-fileshot -c fileshot.yaml
$ cat strelka.log | jq .
```

Terminal 1 runs a full Strelka cluster with logs printed to stdout and Terminal 2 is used to send files to the cluster. `fileshot.yaml` will need the `patterns` field updated to identify files to scan, by default scan results will be written to `./strelka.log`.

## Deployment
### Client Apps
Strelka's core client apps are designed to efficiently integrate a wide-range of systems (Windows, Mac, Linux) with a cluster. Out of the box client apps are written in Go and custom clients can be written in any language supported by gRPC.

#### strelka-fileshot
This client app is designed to one-shot upload files and retrieve their results. This app can be applied in many scenarios, including on-demand file scanning from analysts triaging malware, scheduled file scanning on remote systems, and one-time file scanning on during incident response.

#### strelka-filestream
This client app is designed to continuously stream files and retrieves their results. This app is intended for use on systems that continuously generate files, such as network security monitoring (NSM) sensors, email gateways, and web proxies. Note that this client application *moves files on the filesystem* before sending files for scanning.

#### strelka-webscrape (TODO)
This client app is designed to recursively scrape websites, upload their contents, and retrieve the results. This app is intended for monitoring websites for third party compromise or malicious code injection.

### Server Components
#### strelka-frontend
This server component is the frontend for a cluster -- clients can connect directly a single frontend or to many frontends via [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/).

#### strelka-backend
This server component is the backend for a cluster -- this is where files submitted to the cluster are processed.

#### strelka-manager
This server component manages portions of Strelka's Redis databases.

#### coordinator
This server component is a Redis server that coordinates tasks and data between the frontend and backend. This component is compatible with Envoy's Redis load balancing capabilities.

#### gatekeeper
This server component is a Redis server that acts as a temporary event cache. This component is not compatible with Envoy's Redis load balancing capabilities.

#### mmrpc
This is an optional server component that turns the [MaliciousMacroBot](https://github.com/egaus/MaliciousMacroBot) project into a networked service with gRPC.

* "tasting.yara_rules": location of the directory of YARA files that contains rules used to taste files (defaults to /etc/strelka/taste/)

##### scanners
The "scanners" section controls which scanners are assigned to each file; each scanner is assigned by mapping flavors, filenames, and sources from this configuration to the file. "scanners" must always be a dictionary where the key is the scanner name (e.g. `ScanZip`) and the value is a list of dictionaries containing values for mappings, scanner priority, and scanner options.

Assignment occurs through a system of positive and negative matches: any negative match causes the scanner to skip assignment and at least one positive match causes the scanner to be assigned. A unique identifier (`*`) is used to assign scanners to all flavors. See [File Distribution, Scanners, Flavors, and Tasting](#file-distribution-scanners-flavors-and-tastes) for more details on flavors.

Below is a sample configuration that runs the scanner "ScanHeader" on all files and the scanner "ScanRar" on files that match a YARA rule named "rar_file".
```yaml
scanners:
  'ScanHeader':
    - positive:
        flavors:
          - '*'
      priority: 5
      options:
        length: 50
  'ScanRar':
    - positive:
        flavors:
          - 'rar_file'
      priority: 5
      options:
        limit: 1000
```

The "positive" dictionary determines which flavors, filenames, and sources cause the scanner to be assigned. Flavors is a list of literal strings while filenames and sources are regular expressions. One positive match will assign the scanner to the file.

Below is a sample configuration that shows how RAR files can be matched against a YARA rule (`rar_file`), a MIME type (`application/x-rar`), and a filename (any that end with `.rar`).
```yaml
scanners:
  'ScanRar':
    - positive:
        flavors:
          - 'application/x-rar'
          - 'rar_file'
        filename: '\.rar$'
      priority: 5
      options:
        limit: 1000
```

Each scanner also supports negative matching through the "negative" dictionary. Negative matches occur before positive matches, so any negative match guarantees that the scanner will not be assigned. Similar to positive matches, negative matches support flavors, filenames, and sources.

Below is a sample configuration that shows how RAR files can be positively matched against a YARA rule (`rar_file`) and a MIME type (`application/x-rar`), but only if they are not negatively matched against a filename (`\.rar$`). This configuration would cause `ScanRar` to only be assigned to RAR files that do not have the extension ".rar".
```yaml
scanners:
  'ScanRar':
    - negative:
        filename: '\.rar$'
      positive:
        flavors:
          - 'application/x-rar'
          - 'rar_file'
      priority: 5
      options:
        limit: 1000
```

Each scanner supports multiple mappings -- this makes it possible to assign different priorities and options to the scanner based on the mapping variables. If a scanner has multiple mappings that match a file, then the first mapping wins.

Below is a sample configuration that shows how a single scanner can apply different options depending on the mapping.
```yaml
scanners:
  'ScanX509':
    - positive:
        flavors:
          - 'x509_der_file'
      priority: 5
      options:
        type: 'der'
    - positive:
        flavors:
          - 'x509_pem_file'
      priority: 5
      options:
        type: 'pem'
```

### Encryption and Authentication
Strelka's client apps and server components support encryption and authentication (EA) via Envoy.

#### Envoy
Envoy is a highly regarded, open source proxy created by Lyft and used by many large organizations. One Envoy proxy can provide EA between clients and frontends while many Envoy proxies can provide end-to-end EA. This repository contains two Envoy proxy configurations to help users get started, both are found in `misc/envoy/*`.

#### Certstrap
If users do not have an SSL certificate managing system, then we recommend using [certstrap](https://github.com/square/certstrap), an open source certificate manager created by Square.

### Clusters
The following are recommendations and considerations to keep in mind when deploying clusters.

#### Design Patterns
Strelka's container-based design allows for significant flexibility in designing a distributed system that works for your environment. Below are some recommended design patterns.

##### Quickstart
The quickstart pattern is intended for demonstration and integration testing. With this pattern, all server components run on a single host. Not intended for clusters scanning more than 10k files per day or large bursts of files.

##### Short Stack
The short stack pattern is intended for small-to-medium environments. With this pattern, server components are distributed onto at least three hosts -- one running a frontend, one running Redis databases, and one or more running backends. Horizontally scaling backends allows users to scan many more files per day and handle large bursts of file activity.

##### Tall Stack
The tall stack pattern is intended for large-to-huuuuuuge environments. With this pattern, server components are fully distributed across many hosts -- one running two instances of Envoy, multiple running frontends, multiple running backends, and multiple running Redis databases. Horizontally scaling frontends, backends, and Redis databases allows you to handle any volume of files you want.

#### General Recommendations
The following recommendations apply to all clusters:
* Do not over-allocate backend CPUs
    * .75 backend per CPU is recommended
        * On a server with 4 CPUs, 3 are used by backednds
        * On a server with 8 CPUs, 6 are used by backends
* Allocate at least 1GB RAM per backend
    * If backends do not have enough RAM, then there will be excessive memory errors
    * Big files (especially compressed files) require more RAM
* Allocate as much RAM as reasonable to the coordinator(s)

#### Sizing Considerations
Multiple variables should be considered when determining the appropriate size for a cluster:
* Number of file requests per second
* Diversity of files requested
    * Binary files take longer to scan than text files
* Number of YARA rules deployed
    * Scanning a file with 50,000 rules takes longer than scanning a file with 50 rules

The best way to properly size a cluster is to start small, measure performance, and scale out as needed.

#### Container Considerations
Below is a list of container-related considerations to keep in mind when running a cluster:
* Share volumes (not files) with the container
    * Strelka's backend will read configuration files and YARA rules files when they startup -- sharing volumes with the container ensures that updated copies of these files on the localhost are reflected accurately inside the container without needing to restart the container
* [Increase shm-size](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#options)
    * By default, Docker limits a container's shm size to 64MB -- this can cause errors with Strelka scanners that utilize `tempfile`
* [Set logging options](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/configure/#supported-logging-drivers)
    * By default, Docker has no log limit for logs output by a container

#### Management
Due to its distributed design, we recommend using container orchestration (e.g. Kubernetes) or configuration management/provisioning (e.g. Ansible, SaltStack, etc.) systems for managing clusters.

## Architecture
### Overview
Strelka's architecture allows clients ("client(s)") to submit files to one or many intake servers ("frontend(s)") which coordinate requests with caching (Redis) and processing servers ("backend(s)"). In combination, all server components create a "cluster." During file processing, files are sent through a series of data and file extraction modules ("scanners") via a user-defined distribution system ("tastes" and "flavors"); file scan results are sent back to the client and can be intercepted by the frontend, from which they can be sent to downstream analytics platforms (e.g. ElasticStack, Splunk, etc.).

This architecture makes the following deployments possible:
* 1-to-1 cluster (one client to one backend)
* 1-to-N cluster (one client to N backends)
* N-to-1 cluster (N clients to one backend)
* N-to-N cluster (N clients to N backends)

The most practical deployment is an N-to-N cluster -- this creates a fully scalable deployment that can be modified in-place without requiring significant cluster downtime.

### Networking
Clients and frontends communicate using gRPC, frontends and backends communicate using Redis.

### Messaging
gRPC uses [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) (protobuf) as its messaging format. File requests are converted into gRPC-valid protobuf (defined in `src/go/api/strelka/` and `src/python/strelka/proto/`) and represent a strict contract for how clients should communicate with a cluster. New clients can be written in [any language supported by gRPC](https://grpc.io/faq/).

### Data
Configuration files are written in YAML format. Events are output as JSON using snakecase-formatted fields. Timestamp metadata follows [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) when appropriate.

## Design
### Communication
Communication occurs through a combination of gRPC and Redis.

#### Client-to-Frontend
Client-to-frontend communication uses bi-directional gRPC streams. Clients upload their requests in chunks and receive scan results one-by-one for their request. If a file request is successful, then clients will always receive scan results for their requests and can choose how to handle these results.

#### Frontend-to-Backend
Frontend-to-backend communication uses one or many Redis server, referred to as the 'coordinator' or 'coordinators'.

The coordinator acts as a task queue between the frontend and backend, a temporary file cache for the backend, and the database where the backend sends scan results for the frontend to pick up and send to the client. The coordinator can be scaled horizontally via Envoy's Redis proxy.

### Frontend-to-Gatekeeper
Frontend-to-gatekeeper communication relies on one Redis server, referred to as the 'gatekeeper'.

The gatekeeper is a temporary event cache from which the frontend can optionally retrieve events. As file chunks stream into the frontend, they are hashed with SHA256 and, when the file is complete, the frontend checks the gatekeeper to see if it has any events related to the requested file. If events exist and the client has not set the option to bypass the gatekeeper, then the cached file events are sent back to the client.

### File Distribution, Scanners, Flavors, and Tastes
Strelka's file distribution assigns scanners (`src/python/strelka//scanners/`) to files based on a system of "flavors" and "tastes". Flavors describe the type of file being distributed through the system and come in three types:
* MIME flavors -- assigned by libmagic (e.g. "application/zip")
* YARA flavors -- assigned by YARA rule matches (e.g. "zip_file")
* External flavors -- assigned by a parent file (e.g. "zip")

As files enter the system, they are tasted (e.g. scanned with YARA), their flavor is identified, and the flavor is checked for a corresponding mapping in the scan configuration (`configs/python/backend/strelka.yaml`, see [Scan Configuration](#scan-configuration) for more details) -- flavors are the primary method through which scanners are assigned to files.

### protobuf
#### `ScanFileRequest` protobuf
Below is a description of the keys included in the `ScanFileRequest` protobuf. All keys are optional unless otherwise specified as required. This protobuf can be used to create new client apps in other programming languages supported by gRPC.
* "bytes": file data (required)
* "request.id": string used to identify the request
* "request.client": string used to identify the Strelka client app
* "request.source": string used to identify the system or source of the request
* "attributes.filename": string containing the name of the file in the request
* "attributes.metadata": map of strings that contains metadata associated with the request

#### `ScanHttpRequest` protobuf (unimplemented)
Below is a description of the keys included in the `ScanHttpRequest` protobuf. All keys are optional unless otherwise specified as required. This protobuf can be used to create new client apps in other programming languages supported by gRPC.
* "url": url from which file data will be retrieved (required)
* "request.id": string used to identify the request
* "request.client": string used to identify the Strelka client app
* "request.source": string used to identify the system or source of the request
* "attributes.filename": string containing the name of the file in the request
* "attributes.metadata": map of strings that contains metadata associated with the request

## Scanners
Each scanner parses files of a specific flavor and performs data collection and/or file extraction on them. Scanners are typically named after the type of file they are intended to scan (e.g. "ScanHtml", "ScanPe", "ScanRar") but may also be named after the type of function or tool they use to perform their tasks (e.g. "ScanExiftool", "ScanHeader", "ScanOcr").

### Scanner List
The table below describes each scanner and its options. Each scanner has the hidden option "scanner_timeout" which can override the distribution scanner_timeout.

## Use Cases
Below are some select use cases that show the value Strelka can add to a threat detection tech stack. Keep in mind that these results are parsed in real time without post-processing and are typically correlated with other detection/response tools (e.g. Bro, Volatility, etc.). The file metadata shown below was derived from files found in [VirusShare](https://virusshare.com/) torrent no. 323 and from a test file in the [MaliciousMacroBot (MMBot) repository](https://github.com/egaus/MaliciousMacroBot).

### Extracting nested files
Strelka scanners can decompress and unarchive child files from a wide variety of common file formats, including gzip, ISO, RAR, tar, and ZIP. Child files can also be extracted from files that are not typically thought of as file containers, including MZ, HTML, and XML. Child files are recursively scanned by the system and retain their relationship to parent files via unique identifiers (`uid`, `parent_uid`, and `root_uid`).

Below is a partial scan result for a ZIP file that contains DLLs, MZ, and text files -- this shows which scanner extracted the child files and the order in which Strelka extracted them.

### Identifying malicious scripts
Strelka supports scanning some of the most common types of malicious script files (JavaScript, VBScript, etc.). Not only are these scripts parsed, but they are also extracted out of relevant parent files -- for example, JavaScript and VBScript can be extracted out of HTML files and VBA code can be extracted out of OLE files.

Below is a partial scan result for an HTML file that contains a malicious VBScript file that contains an encoded Windows executable file. HTML hyperlinks are redacted to prevent accidental navigation.

### Identifying suspicious executables
Strelka supports parsing executables across Linux (ELF), Mac (Mach-O), and Windows (MZ). Metadata parsed from these executables can be verbose, including logging the functions imported by Mach-O and MZ files and the segments imported by ELF files. This level of detail allows analysts to fingerprint executables beyond todays common techniques (e.g. [imphash](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/01/tracking-malware-import-hashing.html)).

Below is a partial scan result for an MZ file that shows PE metadata.

### Identifying suspicious text
Strelka supports extracting body text from document files (MS Word, PDF, etc.) and optical text from image files (using Optical Character Recognition, OCR). Extracted text is treated like any other file -- it is hashed, scanned with YARA, and parsed with text-specific scanners. This makes it relatively easy to track patterns in phishing activity, especially when threat actors leverage indirect methods of malware delivery (e.g. sending the target a hyperlink in an email body).

Below is a complete scan result for a text file that appears to be a shell script containing an IP address. The IP address is redacted to prevent accidental navigation.
```json

### Interacting with external systems
At release, Strelka supports sending files to a Cuckoo sandbox and sending VBScript files to a networked instance of MMBot.
