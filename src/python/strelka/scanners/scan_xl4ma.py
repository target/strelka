    Strelka scanner for extracting Excel 4 cell contents and IOCs.

    This scanner uses the xl4ma analyzer to extract data from Excel files.
    It attempts to decode Excel 4 cell contents and extract any potential IOCs.
    Extracted data is added to the scanner's event, and IOCs are processed
    using the scanner's IOC processing capabilities.

    Attributes inherited from strelka.Scanner:
        - name (str): Name of the scanner class.
        - key (str): Metadata key used to identify scanner metadata in scan results.
        - event (dict): Dictionary containing the result of the scan.
        - flags (list): List of flags raised during scanning.
        - iocs (list): List of IOCs extracted during scanning.
