    Strelka scanner for extracting URLs from IQY (Excel Web Query Internet Inquire) files.

    IQY files are typically used to import data into Excel from the web. They often contain URLs
    that specify the data source. This scanner aims to extract these URLs and process them for IOCs.

    The following is a typical format of an IQY file:
    WEB
    1
    [URL]
    [optional parameters]

    Reference for IQY file format: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.querytable
